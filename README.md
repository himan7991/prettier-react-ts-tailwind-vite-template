# P.RE.T.T.V - Prettier React Typescript Tailwind Vite Template

P.RE.T.T.V is a fork of [nrabhiram's Vite React Typescript Tailwind Template](https://github.com/nrabhiram/vite-react-ts-tailwind-template).

It uses Prettier, React TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite and is a template to be used as a starting point for new projects. It also includes the Prettier plugin for Tailwind CSS class auto-sorting, sample folders, and path aliases for better/cleaner imports.

Note: to keep the sample folders from being ignored, I have added some empty `.gitkeep` files. You can delete them or add them to your `.gitignore` file, but keep in mind that empty folders are not synced to GitHub
